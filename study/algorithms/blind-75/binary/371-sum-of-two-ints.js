// The left shift operator (<<) 
// shifts the first operand 
// the specified number of bits to the left. 
// Excess bits shifted off to the left are discarded. 
// Zero bits are shifted in from the right.

// & is a bitwise AND operator. && is the only logical AND operator in Javascript.

const a = 5;         // 00000000000000000000000000000101
const b = 2;         // 00000000000000000000000000000010

console.log(a << b); // 00000000000000000000000000010100
// expected output: 20

// Approach:
// XOR - for adding, but need to deal with carry
// 8 = 1000, 9 = 1001
// 8 ^ 9 = 0001

// For carry at the 4th bit, we can use AND
// 8 & 9 = 1000 (this shows bit positions from where carry needs to be forwarded to the next bit addition)

// since carry is forwarded to the next bit addition, shift the carry to the left
// => 8 & 9 << 1 => 10000

// then we add:
// 10000 ^ 0001 = 10001 (17)

// Will have to keep on doing this until carry is 0.

var getSum = function(a, b) {
    while(b) {
        const carry = a & b;
        a = a ^ b;
        b = carry << 1;
    }
    return a;
}


//another with long description below
var getSum = function(a, b) {
    let carry;
    while((a & b) !== 0){
        carry = (a & b) << 1;
        a = a ^ b;
        b = carry;
    }
    return a ^ b;
};


// Ok, so we all know that numbers represented on computers are groups of 1's and 0's (binary, two states). Like in decimal, what we are all familar with (base 10), when we add numbers and they exceed the base (10), we add to the next column left.

// For example adding 5+6 (both numbers using "units" place), and get 1 (tens place) and 1 (units place). The point is, that adding numbers will fill the "units" bucket, and overflow to the next one as needed. So, what's important? Add the numbers to the "units" bucket, and keep track of the overflow.

// in binary, xor or ^ will add digits (but doesn't care about overflow). XOR/exclusive or, works like or, but if both are positive, it switches to negative,

// so 4+3
// 100
// 011

// 111 (because 1 or 0 is 1 in xor)
// this makes sense because in binary, 3+4 also equals 7

// what about 5+1?
// 101
// 001

// 100, that's 4, but 5+1 = 6, not four. That's because we have a carry. The rightmost 1's should carry to the next place, so that's where the next part of the process comes, the &. The AND will only return 1 when both are 1 so, so 001+001 = 001, and we shift it left with << 1, so it becomes 010 or 2, so it's 4(100)+2(010) which equals 6 (110)

// So, for this to work we need to add the numbers with xOR ^, and also add the carry that comes from AND &.

// When we do that, it's possible that again, we have a carry, so we would need to repeat. think about binary of 3+7.
// 011 (3)
// 111 (7)
// XOR
// 100 (4)

// AND
// 011 (3) since it is the carry, we shift <<1, so it becomes 110 or 6. now we add using ^, but that gets us

// 100
// 110
// XOR
// 010 or 2, but we also still have a new carry which is 100 & 110 or 100 and shifted <<1 is 1000. add that to the 010 and we have 1010 or 10.

// So the point of the second example is that you keep having to run the operation whenever there is a carry. In my first example I did it with the loop, below with recursion.

// Recursive with syntactic sugar

// var getSum = function(a, b) {
//     return b ? getSum(a ^ b, (a & b) << 1) : a;
// };
// I hope this example helped to understand how the binary operations actually happen, if it helped you, maybe you could upvote it so others might notice it.

// Btw, it's called a half adder and is physically used in building physical memory/computer systems. I learned in at UMD, College Park in CS311 computer architecture a long time ago, happy to see that it was useful :-)
