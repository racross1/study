// Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

// Follow up: Could you implement a solution using only O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) runtime complexity?

 

// Example 1:

// Input: nums = [3,0,1]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
// Example 2:

// Input: nums = [0,1]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
// Example 3:

// Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
// Output: 8
// Explanation: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
// Example 4:

// Input: nums = [0]
// Output: 1
// Explanation: n = 1 since there is 1 number, so all numbers are in the range [0,1]. 1 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.


//one that beats on 99%
//makes array of size n+1 and leaves a spot for missing element
//for const num of nums in the below is particularly interesting because it assigns to the array based on value
var missingNumber = function(nums) {
    // construct array of size n+1, to leave a spot for the missing element.
	// Assign each val to -1 so we can see which position was not filled
    // O(n)
    const res = new Array(nums.length+1).fill(-1);
	
	// "sort" the elements by assigning to the array based on val
    // O(n)
    for(const num of nums) {
        res[num] = num;
    }
    
	// the remaining -1 index is the missing value
    // O(n-1)
    return res.indexOf(-1);
};


//another solution which uses sum

var missingNumber = function(nums) {
    let sum = 0, total = 0
    for(let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        sum += nums[i]
        total += i + 1
    }
    return total - sum
};


//mine - has poor time complexity performance compared to others
var missingNumber = function(nums) {
  
    let numsSorted = nums.sort((a,b) => a - b)
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length+1; i++){
        if (!nums.includes(i)){
            return i
        }
        }
   
};

nums1 = [3,0,1]
nums2 = [0,1]
nums3 = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
nums4 = [0]

console.log(missingNumber(nums3))
