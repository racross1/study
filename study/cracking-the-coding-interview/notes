To remove all characters that are not alphabets (english alphabets)
In your case, it might be:

str = str.replace(/[^A-Za-z']/g, "");
...which will replace except the English characters A-Z (ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ), a-z (abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz), and the single quote with nothing (e.g., remove it).

include also numbers
console.log(str.replace(/[^A-Za-z0-9]/g, ''))
console.log(str8.replace(/[^A-Za-z\d]/g, ''))

above for only letters also seems to work without '
